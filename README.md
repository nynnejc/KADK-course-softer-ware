# MÃ¸nstre i Modstand
>Course Material for Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts ([KADK](https://kadk.dk/en/)) course taught with [Laboratory for Aesthetics and Ecology](http://www.labae.org/) &amp; [Mace Ojala](https://github.com/xmacex).


This class for bachelor students serves as an intro to programming & weaving. The course covers the history of the computer, feminist theory, technology criticism and the connection between programming and crafting techniques. 

## Binary Code & the Loom

Textile techniques led to the invention of the first computer. Even today, textile techniques are potent metaphors for understanding the 'web' and everything digital. With this workshop, participants will be introduced to the Jacquard machine and the story of how punchcard weaving technology evolved to modern day computers. 

Participants will be offered a hands-on weaving demo to fully understand the connections between warp and weft and the most basic concepts running devices today (the binary system). This workshop highlights the history of computers, the tactility of programming and last but not least sheds light on an under-appreciated connection between craft traditions and innovative technologies.
